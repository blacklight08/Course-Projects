Working Model:-
	Change will not be returned.
	The standard state machine with three states i.e Reset, Wait, Process.
	 Once the amount is attained coke is vended which is shown for a whole complete cycle and then the state machine shifts back to reset state.
	 Since the adder and comparator are combinational elements, their values are used to compare the value of cost of each coke.
	 The comparator returns '1' when sum crosses 20.
	 Once the value is taken the processing light glows, the next value is not to be entered until the processing light doesn't glow.
	 Binary Encoding Used - 
	 		rest - '00'
	 		process- '01'
	 		wait - '11'
	 Inputs -
	 		c - comparator putput
	 		w - input is given condition.
	 
	 
Not Working Model:-
	Change can be returned. (Finite and Infinite Change)
	
	Second state machine is used which encapsulates the previous model
	This model used before and after the previous model, before aspect of this is to instantiate the values in registers, aftermath is to return the change using various de-muxs' and muxs'.
	Various new registers are used to save the number and type of coins given by the user.
	The logic of the aftermath returns us the # of coins to be returned or says we cannot return the change.
	If the change cannot be returned the circuit returns '0', so our work is to returnthe values in the registers used save the coins entered by the user.
